# World_vaccination_data_analysis
This is my Data Analysis project for MSU course "Programming and data analysis in Python".

Link to the course is [here](https://github.com/MSUcourses/Data-Analysis-with-Python/tree/main/Python).
It shows the data of world vaccinations rates. 
I clean this dataset, plot it, make linear regression of the graphs and predict the end of vaccinations across continents.

Created by the end of 2021, autumn semester.
