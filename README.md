# World_vaccination_data_analysis
This is my Data Analysis project for MSU course "Basics of programming and data analysis in Python".
It shows the data of world vaccinations dinamics. 
I clean this dataset, plot it, make linear regression of the graphs and predict the end of vaccinations across continents.

Created by the end of 2021, autumn semester.
