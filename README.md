# Vaccination rates

## Introduction
This is my Data Analysis project for MSU course "Data analysis with Python", Autumn semester 2021. 
Link to the course is [here](https://github.com/MSUcourses/Data-Analysis-with-Python/tree/main/Python).


## Assignment
Find a dataframe, statistically describe it, remove or fill in the missing values, visualise the patterns in data and make a prediction on the basis of the obtained data.  

In this case, the dataframe describing COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress was chosen. After cleaning the data and visualising the rates of vaccinations in different countries and continents, the vaccinations data was fitted by non-linear regression and date was predicted when each country can achive herd immunity from COVID-19.

The result of this project is a dataframe containing id the names of the countries and the predicted date when the population is fully vaccinated.
